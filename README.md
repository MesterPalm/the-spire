This is a small example of simple 3D graphics written using SFML.
Probably not how anything should be built for anything serious, but I had fun and that is what matters.
Simple practice refrence for myself how to create 3D graphics and structure Rust projects.

WASD to move, RF to ascend and descend and ←↑→↓ and PgUp/PgDown too look around.
